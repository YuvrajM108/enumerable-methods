# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerable Methods

In this project I have built my own versions of the most commonly used enumerable methods in Ruby. These methods are typically used to access and modify elements within an array. The following is a list of the methods that were rebuilt in this project:

- ```#each```
- ```#each_with_index```
- ```#select```
- ```#all?```
- ```#any?```
- ```#none?```
- ```#count```
- ```#map```
- ```#inject```

In order to build my own versions of these methods, I used loops, conditional statements, and code blocks.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec TDD

## Getting Started

- To make a copy of the project on your local machine, you can either download the project files in a zip folder or type 'git clone' into your git commandline followed by the URL of this repository.

- Once you have copied the project to your local machine, open your terminal in the project directory and run the project by typing 'ruby enumerable_methods.rb' into the terminal.

#### Testing With Rspec
- Test cases have been written carefully to make sure custom enumerable methods works as expected
- From the Terminal run the command
```
$ rspec
```
And see all test pass.
