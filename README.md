# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerable Methods

In this project I have built my own versions of the most commonly used enumerable methods in Ruby. These methods are typically used to access and modify elements within an array. The following is a list of the methods that were rebuilt in this project:

- ```#each```
- ```#each_with_index```
- ```#select```
- ```#all?```
- ```#any?```
- ```#none?```
- ```#count```
- ```#map```
- ```#inject```

In order to build my own versions of these methods, I used loops, conditional statements, and code blocks.
